### Framework Showcase

The code from this chapter consists of a few sample framework projects that you can try on your machine. This will help you get a sense how different types of frameworks function and the developer experience around them.

To browser the frameworks ensure that you have configured Node.js on your machine. Once `npm --version` works properly in your terminal, follow these steps:
1. Use `npm install` to fetch the dependencies.
2. After the installation successfully completes, run `npm start` to get the prompt to showcase the framework.
3. Follow the instructions in the selected prompt to preview the frameworks. In most cases the framework will start a server on a particular port or start an application.

Besides starting applications or servers, the framework directories all have a `package.json` file that you can take a look at.
In this file you will find additional commands that you can execute for additional functionality of the framework.

## What is this book about?

If you’re a JavaScript novice or an expert who wants to explore the world of JavaScript frameworks, this book is for you. This book introduces you to the history of frontend frameworks and guides you through the creation of your own framework. The chapters are designed to help developers build large projects for their full-time jobs and programmers who want to create open-source projects. A clear understanding of the JavaScript programming language as well as experience with existing software frameworks are all prerequisites.	


This book covers the following exciting features:

* Expand your knowledge of JavaScript frameworks within different runtimes and ecosystems
* Get to grips with the technical aspects of structuring framework abstractions in JavaScript
* Gain an understanding of common patterns across various existing frameworks
* Discover the usage of existing tooling such as TypeScript and GraphQL
* Configure performance tests for your project and track down bottlenecks in the code base
* Understand how JavaScript and the web evolve and what these systems will look like in the coming years

**Following is what you need for this book:**

JavaScript frameworks play an essential role in web application development; however, no single framework works perfectly for all projects. This book will help you understand existing projects, design new software architecture, and maintain projects as they grow. You’ll go through software architecture principles with JavaScript, along with a guided example of structuring your project and maintenance guidance.


With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-10).

## Software Requirements

* Operating System: For the code from the repository you can use any environment that supports a terminal and running Node.js, i.e. Windows, Mac OS, and most varieties of Linux.
* Runtime: Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) version 20+ installed. Using the [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) can help with the Node.js version management on your machine.
* Web Browsers: To explore the front-end applications, please use a modern browser like Chrome or a Chrome-like browser.

## Hardware Requirements

* Processor: Any modern multi-core processor (1 GHz or faster).
* RAM: Minimum 512 MB of memory.
* Storage: The Node.js runtime itself takes less than 100 MB space. However, depending upon the size of your project and the number of dependencies, you might need more. It is recommended to allocate about 10 GBs to accommodate for dependencies in the chapters.

## Issues and Requests

Please file an issue if any of the code or examples do not work properly in your environment.
Include the operating system and the Node.js version if you can. Thanks!
